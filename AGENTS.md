## Rules for you, Codex (read every time)
- I'm a student learning AI engineering by building this. I read every line you write.
- Keep code simple: small functions, clear names, no clever tricks, no extra abstraction layers.
- Comment the WHY (not the obvious what). Put a 35 line docstring at the top of each new file saying what it does and where it sits in the flow.
- Do ONLY this phase. When it's done, STOP. Don't start the next phase or add "nice to have" features.
- Never open, read, print, create or edit `.env` or any real secret. If you need a new setting, add it to `.env.example` with a placeholder value and tell me to fill `.env` myself.
- Never log or print API keys, tokens or passwords, even partly.
- Use only the libraries listed in this prompt (plus the standard library). If you think you need another one, ask me first.
- Follow `AGENTS.md` and `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md` in the repo.
- When finished, reply with:
  1. Files created/changed, one line each on why.
  2. The flow of this phase as an arrow chain (a → b → c).
  3. Exact commands for me to test it.
  4. Anything you weren't sure about or skipped.
- Run tests with `uv run pytest`.
